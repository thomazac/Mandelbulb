# Mandelbulb
 
This program is a tool for generating 3D fractals known as Mandelbulbs. It uses Java and Processing 4, along with the PeasyCam library, to create an interactive visual representation of the fractal. The program randomly generates a fractal upon startup, but also allows users to input their own 16-bit arrays (rules) and change the order of the fractal by uncommenting certain lines of code.

# Requirements:

Java 8 or later

Processing 4 or later

PeasyCam library

# How to Use:

Download the repository

Open the program in Processing 4

Press the play button to run the program

Use the mouse to navigate the 3D fractal

To use your own 16-bit array, uncomment the appropriate lines of code in the "setup" function and input your own array.

To change the order of the fractal, uncomment the appropriate line of code in the "setup" function and input your desired order.

# Note:

Make sure that PeasyCam library is installed in Processing 4

The program is intended for educational and artistic use only.

The fractal generation algorithm used in this program is based on the Mandelbulb and is a type of 3D fractals.
